# recur_circuits
a collection of extension circuits for recur - a rpi diy video sampler

currently there is an extension circuit _i_n_c_u_r_ that adds 4x pots, 4x cv and serial-midi to recur. there are also some 3d-panels for euro-mounting. these designs will be found here. also been thinking about other extension circuits that could address different use cases:

- a custom keypad (v cheap / diy) - can output midi (or keystrokes) option to add 4x pots and/or 4xcv ins
- an all in one recur circuit, that has the rpi and custom interface - not as cheap, prob nice buttons, maybe encoders,
